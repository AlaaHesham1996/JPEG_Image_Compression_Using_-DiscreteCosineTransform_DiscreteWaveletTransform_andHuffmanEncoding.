# JPEG_Image_Compression_Using_-DiscreteCosineTransform_DiscreteWaveletTransform_andHuffmanEncoding.
In this respiratory , we compress image using both lossy compression techniques such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) besides lossless compression methods such as Huffman Encoding.
