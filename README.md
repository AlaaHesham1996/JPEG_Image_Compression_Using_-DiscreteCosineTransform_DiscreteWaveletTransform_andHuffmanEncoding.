# JPEG_Image_Compression_Using_DiscreteCosineTransform_DiscreteWaveletTransform_andHuffmanEncoding.
In this respiratory , we perform JPEG image compression using both lossy compression techniques such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) besides lossless compression methods such as Huffman Encoding.
In every python notebook , you could find a useful comments about what we are doing .
The main textbook we have used as a reference is "*H.264 and MPEG-4 Video Compression Video Coding for Next-generation Multimedia By Iain E. G. Richardson*"   
You can find summary of results inside file named "Information theory project report.docx". **The Highest compression ratio achieved is 9.662.**
